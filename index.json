[{"content":"What are Delegates? In Unreal Engine, Delegates provide a callback mechanism that allows one piece of code to notify other parts of the program when something happens. They enable an event-driven programming style by separating the event sender from the event receiver\u0026ndash;meaning the object triggering the event doesn\u0026rsquo;t need to know who is listening, only that it can broadcast the event when needed. This makes code more modular and maitainable.\nTypes of Delegates Unreal Engine provides four main kinds of delegates, each with its own use case:\nSingle – Holds one bound function. Multicast – Can call multiple bound functions. Dynamic – Single delegate that supports reflection and Blueprint binding. Dynamic Multicast – Multicast delegate with reflection and Blueprint binding.
